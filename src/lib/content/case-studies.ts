/**
 * Selected Work and its case-study pages — Prompts 13 and 14.
 *
 * One record drives both the homepage card and `/work/[slug]`, so the two can
 * never describe the same project differently.
 *
 * **The credibility rule applies to every string in this file.** If an
 * interviewer points at a sentence and asks what exactly was done, there has to
 * be a detailed answer:
 *
 * - `public` projects are described from their own codebase. Every
 *   SherryBerries claim below was checked against the repository
 *   (github.com/justinpatterson1/SherryBerriesWebsite) on 2026-09-26 — and
 *   things it does *not* do (restocking on admin cancellation, JSON-LD) are
 *   left out on purpose.
 * - `proprietary` projects are professional work, deliberately generalized:
 *   no employer, server or database names, vendors, formulas, figures or code,
 *   and never a repository link. Their wording stays close to the capability
 *   lists Justin supplied in Prompt 13 and the responsibilities in Prompt 12.
 * - No metrics anywhere. No verified figures have been supplied, so impact is
 *   qualitative only (Prompt 14).
